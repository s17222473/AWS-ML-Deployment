#Use of following AWS services for architecture
- Sagemaker:.
             Supports PyTorch ResNet50 via pre-packaged container.
             Autoscaling policies: Scale-up, Scale-down
             Fault tolerance: Spread containers across AZ, SageMaker ensures health checks and restarts.

-S3:   
      Tarred ResNet50 stored in encrypted (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) S3.
      lifecycle policy 
      Bucket policy only accessible by SageMaker role.

- API Gateway: 
              Publicly exposed HTTPS endpoint
              Throttling: 1000 req/s with burst

-vpc:
     VPC endpoints for S3 and SageMaker to route in-VPC securely

-Cloud Watch:
             SageMaker inference logs (invocation count, model errors).
             Lambda, API Gateway, VPC Flow logs
             Alarms and dashboard

#Fault Tolerance & HA
SageMaker’s multi-AZ endpoint ensures no single-AZ failure.
ASG-like autoscaling across containers.
Lambda + API Gateway are AWS-managed HA.
S3 durability > 99.999999999%.
Regular backups (versioning enabled in S3).

#Monthly Cost
Component	                                                      Monthly Cost
SageMaker Endpoint	                          ml.m5.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GB): ~$0.192/hr → ~$140/mo (720 hr)
S3 Storage	                                  < 50 GB + ~300 GB/month transfer: ~$10–15
API Gateway	                                  1M requests/month: ~$3.50
Lambda	                                          3M invocations/month at 200ms, 512MB: ~$20
CloudWatch	                                  Metrics/logs ~10 GB/month: ~$25
Total	                                          ≈ $200–220/month

# Optimizations
-Serverless: For low‑traffic periods, dynamically switch to SageMaker Serverless→ zero‑RT provisioning.
-Spot instances with SageMaker Managed Spot for dev/test endpoints.
-Batch endpoint for backend classification pipelines (cheaper infrequent loads).
-Model layer caching to reduce cold-start latency.
-S3 intelligent‑tiering for rarely accessed payloads.
